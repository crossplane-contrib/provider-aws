                      \n An asynchronous background process performs the actual deletion,

                      confusion with the double quotes required in the JSON text.
                      \n The following basic restrictions apply to tags: \n * Maximum

                      characters in UTF-8 \n * Maximum value length—255 Unicode characters
                      in UTF-8 \n * Tag keys and values are case sensitive. \n * Do
                      not use the aws: prefix in your tag names or values because
                      AWS reserves it for AWS use. You can't edit or delete tag names
                      or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count
