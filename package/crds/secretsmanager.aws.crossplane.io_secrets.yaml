A tag with the key    \"ABC\" is a different tag from one with key \"abc\". \n    * If you check tags in IAM policy Condition elements as part of your security    strategy, then adding or removing a tag can change permissions. If the    successful completion of this operation would result in you losing your    permissions for this secret, then this operation is blocked and returns    an Access Denied error. \n This parameter requires a JSON text string argument. For information on how to format a JSON parameter for the various command line tool environments, see Using JSON for Parameters (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-using-param.html#cli-using-param-json) in the AWS CLI User Guide. For example: \n [{\"Key\":\"CostCenter\",\"Value\":\"12345\"},{\"Key\":\"environment\",\"Value\":\"production\"}] \n If your command-line tool or SDK requires quotation marks around the parameter, you should use single quotes to avoid confusion with the double quotes required in the JSON text. \n The following basic restrictions apply to tags: \n    * Maximum number of tags per secret—50 \n    * Maximum key length—127 Unicode characters in UTF-8 \n    * Maximum value length—255 Unicode characters in UTF-8 \n    * Tag keys and values are case sensitive. \n    * Do not use the aws: prefix in your tag names or values because AWS reserves    it for AWS use. You can't edit or delete tag names or values with this    prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per secret    limit. \n    * If you use your tagging schema across multiple services and resources,    remember other services might have restrictions on allowed characters.    Generally allowed characters: letters, spaces, and numbers representable    in UTF-8, plus the following special characters: + - = . _ : / @."
