                      address when you create an accelerator. \n After you bring an
                      address range to Amazon Web Services, it appears in your account
                      as an address pool. When you create an accelerator, you can
                      assign one IPv4 address from your range to it. Global Accelerator
                      assigns you a second static IPv4 address from an Amazon IP address
                      range. If you bring two IPv4 address ranges to Amazon Web Services,
                      you can assign one IPv4 address from each range to your accelerator.
                      This restriction is because Global Accelerator assigns each
                      address range to a different network zone, for high availability.

                      have a dual-stack accelerator, you also have a second DNS name,

                      IPv4 addresses and two IPv6 addresses. \n For more information

                      The naming convention for the dual-stack DNS name is the following:

                      Global Accelerator also assigns a default DNS name, DnsName,
                      to your accelerator that points just to the static IPv4 addresses.
