                      visible and Target is the actual Amazon S3 path. If you only
                      specify a target, it will be displayed as is. You will need
                      to also make sure that your IAM role provides access to paths
                      in Target. The following is an example. \n '[ \"/bucket2/documentation\",
                      { \"Entry\": \"your-personal-report.pdf\", \"Target\": \"/bucket3/customized-reports/${transfer:UserName}.pdf\"

                      scope-down policy to lock your user down to the designated home
                      directory (\"chroot\"). To do this, you can set Entry to '/'
                      and set Target to the HomeDirectory parameter value. \n If the
                      target of a logical directory entry does not exist in Amazon
                      S3, the entry will be ignored. As a workaround, you can use
                      the Amazon S3 API to create 0 byte objects as place holders
                      for your directory. If using the CLI, use the s3api call instead
                      of s3 so you can use the put-object operation. For example,
                      you use the following: aws s3api put-object --bucket bucketname
                      --key path/to/folder/. Make sure that the end of the key name
                      ends in a '/' for it to be considered a folder."
