                      and how you want to make them visible. You must specify the
                      Entry and Target pair, where Entry shows how the path is made
                      visible and Target is the actual Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS path.
                      If you only specify a target, it is displayed as is. You also
                      must ensure that your Amazon Web Services Identity and Access
                      Management (IAM) role provides access to paths in Target. This
                      value can only be set when HomeDirectoryType is set to LOGICAL.
                      \n The following is an Entry and Target pair example. \n [ {
                      \"Entry\": \"/directory1\", \"Target\": \"/bucket_name/home/mydirectory\"
                      } ] \n In most cases, you can use this value instead of the
                      session policy to lock your user down to the designated home
                      directory (\"chroot\"). To do this, you can set Entry to / and
                      set Target to the HomeDirectory parameter value. \n The following
                      is an Entry and Target pair example for chroot. \n [ { \"Entry:\":
                      \"/\", \"Target\": \"/bucket_name/home/mydirectory\" } ] \n
                      If the target of a logical directory entry does not exist in
                      Amazon S3 or EFS, the entry is ignored. As a workaround, you
                      can use the Amazon S3 API or EFS API to create 0 byte objects
                      as place holders for your directory. If using the CLI, use the
                      s3api or efsapi call instead of s3 or efs so you can use the
                      put-object operation. For example, you use the following: aws
                      s3api put-object --bucket bucketname --key path/to/folder/.
                      Make sure that the end of the key name ends in a / for it to
                      be considered a folder."
