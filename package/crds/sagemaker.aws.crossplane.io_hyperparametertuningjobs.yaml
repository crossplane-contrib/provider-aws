If you use AugmentedManifestFile, the order of the JSON lines in the AugmentedManifestFile is shuffled. The shuffling order is determined using the Seed value. \n For Pipe input mode, when ShuffleConfig is specified shuffling is done at the start of every epoch. With large datasets, this ensures that the order of the training data is different for each epoch, and it helps reduce bias and possible overfitting. In a multi-node training job when ShuffleConfig is combined with S3DataDistributionType of ShardedByS3Key, the data is shuffled across nodes so that the content sent to a particular node on the first epoch might be sent to a different node on the second epoch."

It also specifies how long you are willing to wait for a managed spot training job to complete. When the job reaches the time limit, Amazon SageMaker ends the training or compilation job. Use this API to cap model training costs. \n To stop a job, Amazon SageMaker sends the algorithm the SIGTERM signal, which delays job termination for 120 seconds. Algorithms can use this 120-second window to save the model artifacts, so the results of training are not lost. \n The training algorithms provided by Amazon SageMaker automatically save the intermediate results of a model training job when possible. This attempt to save artifacts is only a best effort case as model might not be in a state from which it can be saved. For example, if training has just started, the model might not be ready to save. When saved, this intermediate data is a valid model artifact. You can use it to create a model with CreateModel. \n The Neural Topic Model (NTM) currently does not support saving intermediate model artifacts. When training NTMs, make sure that the maximum runtime is sufficient for the training job to complete."

If you use AugmentedManifestFile, the order of the JSON lines in the AugmentedManifestFile is shuffled. The shuffling order is determined using the Seed value. \n For Pipe input mode, when ShuffleConfig is specified shuffling is done at the start of every epoch. With large datasets, this ensures that the order of the training data is different for each epoch, and it helps reduce bias and possible overfitting. In a multi-node training job when ShuffleConfig is combined with S3DataDistributionType of ShardedByS3Key, the data is shuffled across nodes so that the content sent to a particular node on the first epoch might be sent to a different node on the second epoch."

Algorithms can use this 120-second window to save the model artifacts, so the results of training are not lost. \n The training algorithms provided by Amazon SageMaker automatically save the intermediate results of a model training job when possible. This attempt to save artifacts is only a best effort case as model might not be in a state from which it can be saved. For example, if training has just started, the model might not be ready to save. When saved, this intermediate data is a valid model artifact. You can use it to create a model with CreateModel. \n The Neural Topic Model (NTM) currently does not support saving intermediate model artifacts. When training NTMs, make sure that the maximum runtime is sufficient for the training job to complete."

If you specify IDENTICAL_DATA_AND_ALGORITHM as the WarmStartType value for the warm start configuration, the training job that performs the best in the new tuning job is compared to the best training jobs from the parent tuning jobs. From these, the training job that performs the best as measured by the objective metric is returned as the overall best training job. \n All training jobs launched by parent hyperparameter tuning jobs and the new hyperparameter tuning jobs count against the limit of training jobs for the tuning job."
