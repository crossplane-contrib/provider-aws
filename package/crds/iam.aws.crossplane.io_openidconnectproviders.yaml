                      you have up to five thumbprints for an OIDC provider. This lets
                      you maintain multiple thumbprints if the identity provider is
                      rotating certificates. \n The server certificate thumbprint
                      is the hex-encoded SHA-1 hash value of the X.509 certificate
                      used by the domain where the OpenID Connect provider makes its
                      keys available. It is always a 40-character string. \n You must
                      provide at least one thumbprint when creating an IAM OIDC provider.
                      For example, assume that the OIDC provider is server.example.com
                      and the provider stores its keys at https://keys.server.example.com/openid-connect.
                      In that case, the thumbprint string would be the hex-encoded
                      SHA-1 hash value of the certificate used by https://keys.server.example.com.

                  and name of a Secret to which any connection details for this managed
                  resource should be written. Connection details frequently include
                  the endpoint, username, and password required to connect to the
                  managed resource. This field is planned to be replaced in a future
                  release in favor of PublishConnectionDetailsTo. Currently, both
                  could be set independently and connection details would be published
                  to both without affecting each other.
