                      is also known as its range attribute. The term \"range attribute\"
                      derives from the way DynamoDB stores items with the same partition
                      key physically close together, in sorted order by the sort key
                      value. \n For a simple primary key (partition key), you must
                      provide exactly one element with a KeyType of HASH. \n For a
                      composite primary key (partition key and sort key), you must
                      provide exactly two elements, in this order: The first element
                      must have a KeyType of HASH, and the second element must have
                      a KeyType of RANGE. \n For more information, see Working with
