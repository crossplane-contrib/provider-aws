                      make your server's endpoint publicly accessible (PUBLIC) or host it inside
                      your VPC. With an endpoint that is hosted in a VPC, you can restrict access
                      to your server and resources only within your VPC or choose to make it internet
                      facing by attaching Elastic IP addresses directly to it.


                      After May 19, 2021, you won't be able to create a server using EndpointType=VPC_ENDPOINT
                      in your Amazon Web Services account if your account hasn't already done so
                      before May 19, 2021. If you have already created servers with EndpointType=VPC_ENDPOINT
                      in your Amazon Web Services account on or before May 19, 2021, you will not
                      be affected. After this date, use EndpointType=VPC.


                      For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/create-server-in-vpc.html#deprecate-vpc-endpoint.


                      It is recommended that you use VPC as the EndpointType. With this endpoint
                      type, you have the option to directly associate up to three Elastic IPv4
                      addresses (BYO IP included) with your server's endpoint and use VPC security
                      groups to restrict traffic by the client's public IP address. This is not
                      possible with EndpointType set to VPC_ENDPOINT.

                      The RSA, ECDSA, or ED25519 private key to use for your SFTP-enabled server.
                      You can add multiple host keys, in case you want to rotate keys, or have
                      a set of active keys that use different algorithms.


                      Use the following command to generate an RSA 2048 bit key with no passphrase:


                      ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -N "" -m PEM -f my-new-server-key.


                      Use a minimum value of 2048 for the -b option. You can create a stronger
                      key by using 3072 or 4096.


                      Use the following command to generate an ECDSA 256 bit key with no passphrase:


                      ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 256 -N "" -m PEM -f my-new-server-key.


                      Valid values for the -b option for ECDSA are 256, 384, and 521.


                      Use the following command to generate an ED25519 key with no passphrase:


                      ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N "" -f my-new-server-key.


                      For all of these commands, you can replace my-new-server-key with a string
                      of your choice.


                      If you aren't planning to migrate existing users from an existing SFTP-enabled
                      server to a new server, don't update the host key. Accidentally changing
                      a server's host key can be disruptive.


                      For more information, see Manage host keys for your SFTP-enabled server (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/edit-server-config.html#configuring-servers-change-host-key)

                      This option also requires you to provide a Directory ID by using the IdentityProviderDetails
                      parameter.


                      Use the API_GATEWAY value to integrate with an identity provider of your

                      endpoint URL to call for authentication by using the IdentityProviderDetails
                      parameter.


                      Use the AWS_LAMBDA value to directly use an Lambda function as your identity
                      provider. If you choose this value, you must specify the ARN for the Lambda

                         * To indicate passive mode (for FTP and FTPS protocols), use the PassiveIp
                         parameter. Enter a single dotted-quad IPv4 address, such as the external
                         IP address of a firewall, router, or load balancer.


                         * To ignore the error that is generated when the client attempts to use
                         the SETSTAT command on a file that you are uploading to an Amazon S3 bucket,
                         use the SetStatOption parameter. To have the Transfer Family server ignore
                         the SETSTAT command and upload files without needing to make any changes
                         to your SFTP client, set the value to ENABLE_NO_OP. If you set the SetStatOption
                         parameter to ENABLE_NO_OP, Transfer Family generates a log entry to Amazon
                         CloudWatch Logs, so that you can determine when the client is making a
                         SETSTAT call.

                         * SFTP (Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol): File transfer over
                         SSH


                         * FTPS (File Transfer Protocol Secure): File transfer with TLS encryption


                         * FTP (File Transfer Protocol): Unencrypted file transfer


                         * AS2 (Applicability Statement 2): used for transporting structured business-to-business
                         data

                         Manager (ACM) which is used to identify your server when clients connect
                         to it over FTPS.

                         be VPC and the IdentityProviderType must be either AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE,
                         AWS_LAMBDA, or API_GATEWAY.

                         types: SERVICE_MANAGED, AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE, AWS_LAMBDA, or API_GATEWAY.


                         * If Protocol includes AS2, then the EndpointType must be VPC, and domain
                         must be Amazon S3.
