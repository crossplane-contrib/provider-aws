                      The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias
                      ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. To use a KMS key in a different Amazon
                      Web Services account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN.

                      This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora DB instances. The Amazon Web
                      Services KMS key identifier is managed by the DB cluster. For more information,
                      see CreateDBCluster.

                      If StorageEncrypted is enabled, and you do not specify a value for the KmsKeyId
                      parameter, then Amazon RDS uses your default KMS key. There is a default
                      KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account
                      has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region.

                      For Amazon RDS Custom, a KMS key is required for DB instances. For most RDS
                      engines, if you leave this parameter empty while enabling StorageEncrypted,
                      the engine uses the default KMS key. However, RDS Custom doesn't use the

                      This setting is valid only if the master user password is managed by RDS
                      in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager for the DB instance.

                      The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias

                      Web Services account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN.

                      If you don't specify MasterUserSecretKmsKeyId, then the aws/secretsmanager

                      Specifies whether the DB instance is publicly accessible.

                      When the DB instance is publicly accessible, its Domain Name System (DNS)
                      endpoint resolves to the private IP address from within the DB instance's
                      virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the public IP address from outside
                      of the DB instance's VPC. Access to the DB instance is ultimately controlled
                      by the security group it uses. That public access is not permitted if the
                      security group assigned to the DB instance doesn't permit it.

                      When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB instance
                      with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.

                      the following applies:

                      A CoIP provides local or external connectivity to resources in your Outpost
                      subnets through your on-premises network. For some use cases, a CoIP can
                      provide lower latency for connections to the DB instance from outside of
                      its virtual private cloud (VPC) on your local network.
