                      operation to be called in the source Amazon Web Services Region

                      only when you are performing cross-Region replication from an
                      encrypted DB cluster. \n The presigned URL must be a valid request
                      for the CreateDBCluster API operation that can run in the source
                      Amazon Web Services Region that contains the encrypted DB cluster
                      to copy. \n The presigned URL request must contain the following

                      the KMS key to use to encrypt the copy of the DB cluster in
                      the destination Amazon Web Services Region. This should refer

                      is called in the destination Amazon Web Services Region, and

                      (ARN) format for the source Amazon Web Services Region. For
                      example, if you are copying an encrypted DB cluster from the

                      \n If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI,
                      you can specify SourceRegion (or --source-region for the CLI)
                      instead of specifying PreSignedUrl manually. Specifying SourceRegion
                      autogenerates a presigned URL that is a valid request for the
                      operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Region.

                      request new connections to the reader endpoint, Aurora distributes
                      the connection requests among the Aurora Replicas in the DB
                      cluster. This functionality can help balance your read workload
                      across multiple Aurora Replicas in your DB cluster. \n If a
                      failover occurs, and the Aurora Replica that you are connected
                      to is promoted to be the primary instance, your connection is
                      dropped. To continue sending your read workload to other Aurora
                      Replicas in the cluster, you can then reconnect to the reader
                      endpoint."
