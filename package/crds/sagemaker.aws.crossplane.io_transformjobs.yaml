The value in MaxPayloadInMB must be greater than, or equal to, the size of a single record. To estimate the size of a record in MB, divide the size of your dataset by the number of records. To ensure that the records fit within the maximum payload size, we recommend using a slightly larger value. The default value is 6 MB. \n For cases where the payload might be arbitrarily large and is transmitted using HTTP chunked encoding, set the value to 0. This feature works only in supported algorithms. Currently, Amazon SageMaker built-in algorithms do not support HTTP chunked encoding."
