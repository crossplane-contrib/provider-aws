You must recreate your cluster. \n    * Ec2SecurityGroupDeletionFailure: We could not delete the remote access    security group for your managed node group. Remove any dependencies from    the security group. \n    * Ec2LaunchTemplateNotFound: We couldn't find the Amazon EC2 launch template    for your managed node group. You may be able to recreate a launch template    with the same settings to recover. \n    * Ec2LaunchTemplateVersionMismatch: The Amazon EC2 launch template version    for your managed node group does not match the version that Amazon EKS    created. You may be able to revert to the version that Amazon EKS created    to recover. \n    * IamInstanceProfileNotFound: We couldn't find the IAM instance profile    for your managed node group. You may be able to recreate an instance profile    with the same settings to recover. \n    * IamNodeRoleNotFound: We couldn't find the IAM role for your managed    node group. You may be able to recreate an IAM role with the same settings    to recover. \n    * AsgInstanceLaunchFailures: Your Auto Scaling group is experiencing failures    while attempting to launch instances. \n    * NodeCreationFailure: Your launched instances are unable to register    with your Amazon EKS cluster. Common causes of this failure are insufficient    worker node IAM role (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/worker_node_IAM_role.html)    permissions or lack of outbound internet access for the nodes. \n    * InstanceLimitExceeded: Your AWS account is unable to launch any more    instances of the specified instance type. You may be able to request an    Amazon EC2 instance limit increase to recover. \n    * InsufficientFreeAddresses: One or more of the subnets associated with    your managed node group does not have enough available IP addresses for    new nodes. \n    * AccessDenied: Amazon EKS or one or more of your managed nodes is unable    to communicate with your cluster API server. \n    * InternalFailure: These errors are usually caused by an Amazon EKS server-side    issue."
