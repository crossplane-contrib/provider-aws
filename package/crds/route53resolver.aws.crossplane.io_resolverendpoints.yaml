                      CREATING: Resolver is creating and configuring one or more Amazon
                      VPC network interfaces for this endpoint. \n * OPERATIONAL:
                      The Amazon VPC network interfaces for this endpoint are correctly
                      configured and able to pass inbound or outbound DNS queries
                      between your network and Resolver. \n * UPDATING: Resolver is
                      associating or disassociating one or more network interfaces
                      with this endpoint. \n * AUTO_RECOVERING: Resolver is trying
                      to recover one or more of the network interfaces that are associated
                      with this endpoint. During the recovery process, the endpoint
                      functions with limited capacity because of the limit on the
                      number of DNS queries per IP address (per network interface).
                      For the current limit, see Limits on Route 53 Resolver (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/DNSLimitations.html#limits-api-entities-resolver).
                      \n * ACTION_NEEDED: This endpoint is unhealthy, and Resolver
                      can't automatically recover it. To resolve the problem, we recommend
                      that you check each IP address that you associated with the
                      endpoint. For each IP address that isn't available, add another
                      IP address and then delete the IP address that isn't available.
                      (An endpoint must always include at least two IP addresses.)
                      A status of ACTION_NEEDED can have a variety of causes. Here
                      are two common causes: One or more of the network interfaces
                      that are associated with the endpoint were deleted using Amazon
                      VPC. The network interface couldn't be created for some reason
                      that's outside the control of Resolver. \n * DELETING: Resolver
                      is deleting this endpoint and the associated network interfaces."
