To accept HTTPS connections from only viewers that support SNI, set SSLSupportMethod    to sni-only. This is recommended. Most browsers and clients support SNI.    To accept HTTPS connections from all viewers, including those that don’t    support SNI, set SSLSupportMethod to vip. This is not recommended, and    results in additional monthly charges from CloudFront. \n    * The minimum SSL/TLS protocol version that the distribution can use to    communicate with viewers. To specify a minimum version, choose a value    for MinimumProtocolVersion. For more information, see Security Policy    (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValues-security-policy)    in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide. \n    * The location of the SSL/TLS certificate, AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)    (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-overview.html) (recommended)    or AWS Identity and Access Management (AWS IAM) (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html).    You specify the location by setting a value in one of the following fields    (not both): ACMCertificateArn IAMCertificateId \n All distributions support HTTPS connections from viewers. To require viewers to use HTTPS only, or to redirect them from HTTP to HTTPS, use ViewerProtocolPolicy in the CacheBehavior or DefaultCacheBehavior. To specify how CloudFront should use SSL/TLS to communicate with your custom origin, use CustomOriginConfig. \n For more information, see Using HTTPS with CloudFront (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https.html) and Using Alternate Domain Names and HTTPS (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-alternate-domain-names.html) in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide."
