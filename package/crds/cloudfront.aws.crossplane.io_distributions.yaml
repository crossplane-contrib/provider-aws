                          specify the following settings: \n * Which viewers the distribution
                          accepts HTTPS connections from: only viewers that support
                          server name indication (SNI) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication)
                          (recommended), or all viewers including those that don’t
                          support SNI. To accept HTTPS connections from only viewers
                          that support SNI, set SSLSupportMethod to sni-only. This
                          is recommended. Most browsers and clients support SNI. To
                          accept HTTPS connections from all viewers, including those
                          that don’t support SNI, set SSLSupportMethod to vip. This
                          is not recommended, and results in additional monthly charges
                          from CloudFront. \n * The minimum SSL/TLS protocol version
                          that the distribution can use to communicate with viewers.
                          To specify a minimum version, choose a value for MinimumProtocolVersion.

                          of the SSL/TLS certificate, Certificate Manager (ACM) (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-overview.html)

                          You specify the location by setting a value in one of the

                          \n All distributions support HTTPS connections from viewers.
                          To require viewers to use HTTPS only, or to redirect them
                          from HTTP to HTTPS, use ViewerProtocolPolicy in the CacheBehavior
                          or DefaultCacheBehavior. To specify how CloudFront should

                              CNAMEs), use the fields in this type to specify the
                              following settings: \n * Which viewers the distribution
                              accepts HTTPS connections from: only viewers that support
                              server name indication (SNI) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication)
                              (recommended), or all viewers including those that don’t
                              support SNI. To accept HTTPS connections from only viewers
                              that support SNI, set SSLSupportMethod to sni-only.
                              This is recommended. Most browsers and clients support
                              SNI. To accept HTTPS connections from all viewers, including
                              those that don’t support SNI, set SSLSupportMethod to
                              vip. This is not recommended, and results in additional
                              monthly charges from CloudFront. \n * The minimum SSL/TLS
                              protocol version that the distribution can use to communicate
                              with viewers. To specify a minimum version, choose a
                              value for MinimumProtocolVersion. For more information,
                              see Security Policy (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValues-security-policy)
                              in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide. \n * The location
                              of the SSL/TLS certificate, Certificate Manager (ACM)
                              (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-overview.html)

                              (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html).
                              You specify the location by setting a value in one of
                              the following fields (not both): ACMCertificateArn IAMCertificateId
                              \n All distributions support HTTPS connections from
                              viewers. To require viewers to use HTTPS only, or to
                              redirect them from HTTP to HTTPS, use ViewerProtocolPolicy
                              in the CacheBehavior or DefaultCacheBehavior. To specify
                              how CloudFront should use SSL/TLS to communicate with
                              your custom origin, use CustomOriginConfig. \n For more
