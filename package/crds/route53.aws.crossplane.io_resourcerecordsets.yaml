                          You can get the applicable value using the AWS CLI command
                          get-domain-names (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/apigateway/get-domain-names.html):

                          This is the name of the associated CloudFront distribution,
                          such as da1b2c3d4e5.cloudfront.net. \n The name of the record
                          that you're creating must match a custom domain name for

                          For edge-optimized APIs, this is the domain name for the
                          corresponding CloudFront distribution. You can get the value
                          of DnsName using the AWS CLI command describe-vpc-endpoints
                          (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-vpc-endpoints.html).
                          \n CloudFront distribution \n Specify the domain name that
                          CloudFront assigned when you created your distribution.
                          \n Your CloudFront distribution must include an alternate
                          domain name that matches the name of the resource record
                          set. For example, if the name of the resource record set
                          is acme.example.com, your CloudFront distribution must include
                          acme.example.com as one of the alternate domain names. For
                          more information, see Using Alternate Domain Names (CNAMEs)
                          (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/CNAMEs.html)
                          in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide. \n You can't create

                          traffic to a CloudFront distribution. \n For failover alias
                          records, you can't specify a CloudFront distribution for
                          both the primary and secondary records. A distribution must
                          include an alternate domain name that matches the name of
                          the record. However, the primary and secondary records have
                          the same name, and you can't include the same alternate
                          domain name in more than one distribution. \n Elastic Beanstalk
                          environment \n If the domain name for your Elastic Beanstalk
                          environment includes the region that you deployed the environment
                          in, you can create an alias record that routes traffic to
                          the environment. For example, the domain name my-environment.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com
                          is a regionalized domain name. \n For environments that
                          were created before early 2016, the domain name doesn't
                          include the region. To route traffic to these environments,
                          you must create a CNAME record instead of an alias record.
                          Note that you can't create a CNAME record for the root domain
                          name. For example, if your domain name is example.com, you
                          can create a record that routes traffic for acme.example.com
                          to your Elastic Beanstalk environment, but you can't create
                          a record that routes traffic for example.com to your Elastic
                          Beanstalk environment. \n For Elastic Beanstalk environments
                          that have regionalized subdomains, specify the CNAME attribute
                          for the environment. You can use the following methods to
                          get the value of the CNAME attribute: \n * AWS Management
                          Console: For information about how to get the value by using
                          the console, see Using Custom Domains with AWS Elastic Beanstalk

                          Specify the DNS name that is associated with the load balancer.
                          Get the DNS name by using the AWS Management Console, the
                          ELB API, or the AWS CLI. \n * AWS Management Console: Go
                          to the EC2 page, choose Load Balancers in the navigation
                          pane, choose the load balancer, choose the Description tab,
                          and get the value of the DNS name field. If you're routing
                          traffic to a Classic Load Balancer, get the value that begins
                          with dualstack. If you're routing traffic to another type
                          of load balancer, get the value that applies to the record
                          type, A or AAAA. \n * Elastic Load Balancing API: Use DescribeLoadBalancers
                          to get the value of DNSName. For more information, see the

                          name for your accelerator: \n * Global Accelerator API:
                          To get the DNS name, use DescribeAccelerator (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/api/API_DescribeAccelerator.html).

                          \n Specify the domain name of the Amazon S3 website endpoint
                          that you created the bucket in, for example, s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com.
                          For more information about valid values, see the table Amazon

                          zone. \n If you're creating an alias record that has the
                          same name as the hosted zone (known as the zone apex), you
                          can't specify the domain name for a record for which the
                          value of Type is CNAME. This is because the alias record
                          must have the same type as the record that you're routing
                          traffic to, and creating a CNAME record for the zone apex
                          isn't supported even for an alias record."

                          Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains
                          \n If you specify an Elastic Beanstalk environment in DNSName
                          and the environment contains an ELB load balancer, Elastic
                          Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy Amazon
                          EC2 instances that are registered with the load balancer.
                          (An environment automatically contains an ELB load balancer
                          if it includes more than one Amazon EC2 instance.) If you
                          set EvaluateTargetHealth to true and either no Amazon EC2
                          instances are healthy or the load balancer itself is unhealthy,
                          Route 53 routes queries to other available resources that
                          are healthy, if any. \n If the environment contains a single
                          Amazon EC2 instance, there are no special requirements.
                          \n ELB load balancers \n Health checking behavior depends
                          on the type of load balancer: \n * Classic Load Balancers:
                          If you specify an ELB Classic Load Balancer in DNSName,
                          Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy
                          Amazon EC2 instances that are registered with the load balancer.
                          If you set EvaluateTargetHealth to true and either no EC2
                          instances are healthy or the load balancer itself is unhealthy,
                          Route 53 routes queries to other resources. \n * Application
                          and Network Load Balancers: If you specify an ELB Application
                          or Network Load Balancer and you set EvaluateTargetHealth
                          to true, Route 53 routes queries to the load balancer based
                          on the health of the target groups that are associated with
                          the load balancer: For an Application or Network Load Balancer
                          to be considered healthy, every target group that contains
                          targets must contain at least one healthy target. If any
                          target group contains only unhealthy targets, the load balancer
                          is considered unhealthy, and Route 53 routes queries to
                          other resources. A target group that has no registered targets
                          is considered unhealthy. \n When you create a load balancer,
                          you configure settings for Elastic Load Balancing health

                      queries based on the geographic origin of the query. For example,
                      if you want all queries from Africa to be routed to a web server
                      with an IP address of 192.0.2.111, create a resource record
                      set with a Type of A and a ContinentCode of AF. \n Although
                      creating geolocation and geolocation alias resource record sets
                      in a private hosted zone is allowed, it's not supported. \n
                      If you create separate resource record sets for overlapping
                      geographic regions (for example, one resource record set for
                      a continent and one for a country on the same continent), priority
                      goes to the smallest geographic region. This allows you to route
                      most queries for a continent to one resource and to route queries
                      for a country on that continent to a different resource. \n

                      by mapping IP addresses to locations. However, some IP addresses
                      aren't mapped to geographic locations, so even if you create
                      geolocation resource record sets that cover all seven continents,
                      Route 53 will receive some DNS queries from locations that it
                      can't identify. We recommend that you create a resource record
                      set for which the value of CountryCode is *. Two groups of queries
                      are routed to the resource that you specify in this record:

                      geolocation resource record sets and queries from IP addresses
                      that aren't mapped to a location. If you don't create a * resource
                      record set, Route 53 returns a \"no answer\" response for queries
                      from those locations. \n You can't create non-geolocation resource
                      record sets that have the same values for the Name and Type

                      \n When to Specify HealthCheckId \n Specifying a value for HealthCheckId
                      is useful only when Route 53 is choosing between two or more
                      resource record sets to respond to a DNS query, and you want
                      Route 53 to base the choice in part on the status of a health
                      check. Configuring health checks makes sense only in the following
                      configurations: \n * Non-alias resource record sets: You're
                      checking the health of a group of non-alias resource record
                      sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such
                      as multiple weighted records named www.example.com with a type
                      of A) and you specify health check IDs for all the resource
                      record sets. If the health check status for a resource record
                      set is healthy, Route 53 includes the record among the records
                      that it responds to DNS queries with. If the health check status
                      for a resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding
                      to DNS queries using the value for that resource record set.
                      If the health check status for all resource record sets in the
                      group is unhealthy, Route 53 considers all resource record sets
                      in the group healthy and responds to DNS queries accordingly.
                      \n * Alias resource record sets: You specify the following settings:
                      You set EvaluateTargetHealth to true for an alias resource record
                      set in a group of resource record sets that have the same routing
                      policy, name, and type (such as multiple weighted records named
                      www.example.com with a type of A). You configure the alias resource
                      record set to route traffic to a non-alias resource record set
                      in the same hosted zone. You specify a health check ID for the
                      non-alias resource record set. If the health check status is
                      healthy, Route 53 considers the alias resource record set to
                      be healthy and includes the alias record among the records that
                      it responds to DNS queries with. If the health check status
                      is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using
                      the alias resource record set. The alias resource record set
                      can also route traffic to a group of non-alias resource record
                      sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type. In that
                      configuration, associate health checks with all of the resource
                      record sets in the group of non-alias resource record sets.
                      \n Geolocation Routing \n For geolocation resource record sets,
                      if an endpoint is unhealthy, Route 53 looks for a resource record
                      set for the larger, associated geographic region. For example,
                      suppose you have resource record sets for a state in the United
                      States, for the entire United States, for North America, and
                      a resource record set that has * for CountryCode is *, which
                      applies to all locations. If the endpoint for the state resource
                      record set is unhealthy, Route 53 checks for healthy resource
                      record sets in the following order until it finds a resource
                      record set for which the endpoint is healthy: \n * The United
                      States \n * North America \n * The default resource record set
                      \n Specifying the Health Check Endpoint by Domain Name \n If
                      your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name,
                      we recommend that you create a separate health check for each
                      endpoint. For example, create a health check for each HTTP server
                      that is serving content for www.example.com. For the value of
                      FullyQualifiedDomainName, specify the domain name of the server
                      (such as us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of the resource
                      record sets (www.example.com). \n Health check results will
                      be unpredictable if you do the following: \n * Create a health
                      check that has the same value for FullyQualifiedDomainName as
                      the name of a resource record set. \n * Associate that health
                      check with the resource record set."

                      the healthy records. \n * If you have more than eight healthy
                      records, Route 53 responds to different DNS resolvers with different
                      combinations of healthy records. \n * When all records are unhealthy,
                      Route 53 responds to DNS queries with up to eight unhealthy
