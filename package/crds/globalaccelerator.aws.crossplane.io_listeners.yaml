                      affinity gives you control over whether to always route each
                      client to the same specific endpoint. \n Global Accelerator
                      uses a consistent-flow hashing algorithm to choose the optimal
                      endpoint for a connection. If client affinity is NONE, Global
                      Accelerator uses the \"five-tuple\" (5-tuple) properties—source
                      IP address, source port, destination IP address, destination
                      port, and protocol—to select the hash value, and then chooses
                      the best endpoint. However, with this setting, if someone uses
                      different ports to connect to Global Accelerator, their connections
                      might not be always routed to the same endpoint because the
                      hash value changes. \n If you want a given client to always
                      be routed to the same endpoint, set client affinity to SOURCE_IP
                      instead. When you use the SOURCE_IP setting, Global Accelerator
                      uses the \"two-tuple\" (2-tuple) properties— source (client)
                      IP address and destination IP address—to select the hash value.
