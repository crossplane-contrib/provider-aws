                      If the compute environment has a service-linked role, it can't
                      be changed to use a regular IAM role. Likewise, if the compute
                      environment has a regular IAM role, it can't be changed to use
                      a service-linked role. If your specified role has a path other
                      than /, then you must either specify the full role ARN (this
                      is recommended) or prefix the role name with the path. Depending
                      on how you created your Batch service role, its ARN might contain
                      the service-role path prefix. When you only specify the name
                      of the service role, Batch assumes that your ARN doesn't use
                      the service-role path prefix. Because of this, we recommend
                      that you specify the full ARN of your service role when you

                      job queue on the compute resources within the environment. If
                      the compute environment is managed, then it can scale its instances
                      out or in automatically based on the job queue demand. \n If
                      the state is DISABLED, then the Batch scheduler doesn't attempt
                      to place jobs within the environment. Jobs in a STARTING or

                      environments in a DISABLED state may continue to incur billing
