                      where connectionType is VPC_LINK. For a private HTTP integration,
                      the URI is not used for routing. For AWS or AWS_PROXY integrations,
                      the URI is of the form arn:aws:apigateway:{region}:{subdomain.service|service}:path|action/{service_api}.
                      Here, {Region} is the API Gateway region (e.g., us-east-1);
                      {service} is the name of the integrated Amazon Web Services
                      service (e.g., s3); and {subdomain} is a designated subdomain
                      supported by certain Amazon Web Services service for fast host-name
                      lookup. action can be used for an Amazon Web Services service

                      query string. The ensuing {service_api} refers to a supported
                      action {name} plus any required input parameters. Alternatively,
                      path can be used for an Amazon Web Services service path-based

                      Amazon Web Services service, if applicable. For example, for
