                      Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) keys are smaller, offering
                      security comparable to RSA keys but with greater computing efficiency.

                      AWS services may require RSA keys, or only support ECDSA keys
                      of a particular size, while others allow the use of either RSA
                      and ECDSA keys to ensure that compatibility is not broken. Check
