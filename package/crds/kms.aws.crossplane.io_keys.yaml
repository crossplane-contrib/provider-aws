                      for your external key store proxy. \n This parameter is required
                      for a KMS key with an Origin value of EXTERNAL_KEY_STORE. It
                      is not valid for KMS keys with any other Origin value. \n The
                      external key must be an existing 256-bit AES symmetric encryption
                      key hosted outside of Amazon Web Services in an external key
                      manager associated with the external key store specified by
                      the CustomKeyStoreId parameter. This key must be enabled and
                      configured to perform encryption and decryption. Each KMS key
                      in an external key store must use a different external key.
                      For details, see Requirements for a KMS key in an external key

                      in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. \n Each KMS key
                      in an external key store is associated two backing keys. One
                      is key material that KMS generates. The other is the external
                      key specified by this parameter. When you use the KMS key in
                      an external key store to encrypt data, the encryption operation
                      is performed first by KMS using the KMS key material, and then
                      by the external key manager using the specified external key,
