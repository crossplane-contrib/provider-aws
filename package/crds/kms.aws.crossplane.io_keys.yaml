It also determines the encryption algorithms or signing algorithms that the CMK supports. You can't change the CustomerMasterKeySpec after the CMK is created. To further restrict the algorithms that can be used with the CMK, use a condition key in its key policy or IAM policy. For more information, see kms:EncryptionAlgorithm (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/policy-conditions.html#conditions-kms-encryption-algorithm) or kms:Signing Algorithm (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/policy-conditions.html#conditions-kms-signing-algorithm) in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. \n AWS services that are integrated with AWS KMS (http://aws.amazon.com/kms/features/#AWS_Service_Integration) use symmetric CMKs to protect your data.

For help determining whether a CMK is symmetric or asymmetric, see Identifying Symmetric and Asymmetric CMKs (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/find-symm-asymm.html) in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. \n AWS KMS supports the following key specs for CMKs: \n    * Symmetric key (default) SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT (AES-256-GCM) \n    * Asymmetric RSA key pairs RSA_2048 RSA_3072 RSA_4096 \n    * Asymmetric NIST-recommended elliptic curve key pairs ECC_NIST_P256 (secp256r1)    ECC_NIST_P384 (secp384r1) ECC_NIST_P521 (secp521r1) \n    * Other asymmetric elliptic curve key pairs ECC_SECG_P256K1 (secp256k1),    commonly used for cryptocurrencies."

The principals in the key policy must exist and be visible to AWS KMS.    When you create a new AWS principal (for example, an IAM user or role),    you might need to enforce a delay before including the new principal in    a key policy because the new principal might not be immediately visible    to AWS KMS.
