Crossplane Targets:
    cobertura             Generate a coverage report for cobertura applying exclusions on generated files.
    reviewable            Ensure a PR is ready for review.
    submodules            Update the submodules, such as the common build scripts.
    run                   Run crossplane locally, out-of-cluster. Useful for development.
    build-package         Builds the package contents in the package directory (./$(PACKAGE))
    clean-package         Cleans out the generated package directory (./$(PACKAGE))
