* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database types are now supported across Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Microsoft Azure.
See the [PostgreSQL user guide](docs/postgresql.md) for more details about how to deploy and consume PostgreSQL databases with Crossplane.
* A general resource controller implementation has been provided to manage the life-cycle of dynamically provisioned resources, starting with MySQL and PostgreSQL resources.
