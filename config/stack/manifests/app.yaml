title: Crossplane AWS

overviewShort: The AWS Stack enables resource management with Amazon Web Services.
overview: |-
 The Amazon Web Services Crossplane Stack adds support for managing AWS resources in Kubernetes.

 Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS), Amazon ElastiCache, and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) can be provisioned, updated, and deleted by this stack.

# Markdown description of this entry
readme: |
 This `provider-aws` repository is the implementation of a Crossplane infrastructure
 [stack](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/master/design/design-doc-stacks.md) for
 [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com).
 The stack that is built from the source code in this repository can be installed into a Crossplane control plane and adds the following new functionality:

 * Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) that model AWS infrastructure and services (e.g. [Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/), [EKS clusters](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/), etc.)
 * Controllers to provision these resources in AWS based on the users desired state captured in CRDs they create
 * Implementations of Crossplane's [portable resource abstractions](https://crossplane.io/docs/master/running-resources.html), enabling AWS resources to fulfill a user's general need for cloud services
