title: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Crossplane Stack

# Markdown description of this entry
description: |
 This `stack-aws` repository is the implementation of a Crossplane infrastructure
 [stack](https://github.com/crossplaneio/crossplane/blob/master/design/design-doc-stacks.md) for
 [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com).
 The stack that is built from the source code in this repository can be installed into a Crossplane control plane and adds the following new functionality:

 * Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) that model AWS infrastructure and services (e.g. [Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/), [EKS clusters](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/), etc.)
 * Controllers to provision these resources in AWS based on the users desired state captured in CRDs they create
 * Implementations of Crossplane's [portable resource abstractions](https://crossplane.io/docs/master/running-resources.html), enabling AWS resources to fulfill a user's general need for cloud services
