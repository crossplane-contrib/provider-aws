 ## AWS VPC Route Tables

 A route table contains a set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic is directed.

 Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a route table; the table controls the routing for the subnet. A subnet can only be associated with one route table at a time, but you can associate multiple subnets with the same route table.
