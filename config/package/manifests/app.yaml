# Markdown description of this entry
readme: |
 This `provider-aws` repository is a Crossplane infrastructure provider for [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com).
 The provider that is built from the source code in this repository can be installed into a Crossplane control plane and adds the following new functionality:

 * Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) that model AWS infrastructure and services (e.g. [Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/), [EKS clusters](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/), etc.)
 * Controllers to provision these resources in AWS based on the users desired state captured in CRDs they create
 * Implementations of Crossplane's portable resource abstractions, enabling AWS resources to fulfill a user's general need for cloud services
