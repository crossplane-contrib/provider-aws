 ## Amazon ElastiCache Replication Groups

 Amazon ElastiCache makes it easy to set up, manage, and scale distributed in-memory cache environments in the AWS Cloud. It provides a high performance, resizable, and cost-effective in-memory cache, while removing complexity associated with deploying and managing a distributed cache environment.

 Single-node Amazon ElastiCache Redis clusters are in-memory entities with limited data protection services (AOF). If your cluster fails for any reason, you lose all the cluster's data. However, if you're running the Redis engine, you can group 2 to 6 nodes into a cluster with replicas where 1 to 5 read-only nodes contain replicate data of the group's single read/write primary node. In this scenario, if one node fails for any reason, you do not lose all your data since it is replicated in one or more other nodes. Due to replication latency, some data may be lost if it is the primary read/write node that fails.
